            While aiming to support resource use, watershed management practices have often resulted in
            unintended environmental impacts. For example, stump harvesting for biomass production in
            Northern Europe is believed to increase the transport of harmful solutes such as methyl mercury.
            Similarly, wetland drainage in North America, driven by agricultural intensification, is linked to
            higher risks of lake eutrophication and more frequent droughts and floods. These examples
            reflect a broader challenge: how can we enhance forest biomass production and agricultural
            productivity while minimizing negative impacts on water quality and ecosystem health? Our
            research group works to address this gap by developing science-based tools and knowledge that
            help balance resource development with environmental protection in watershed management.

            The HydroGeoScience for Watershed Management Laboratory works to advance quantitative
            understanding of how water and solutes move through both shallow and deep parts of the Earth.
            We investigate how these transport processes are influenced by land development and climate
            variability. This knowledge is essential for developing science-based watershed management
            strategiesâ€”particularly for identifying areas where intensive land use can take place with
            minimal environmental impact on local and regional ecosystems. To support this work, we also
            develop innovative, physics-informed statistical and machine learning models that use large
            datasets to detect key patterns and processes in watershed systems. Through this approach, we
            provide the tools and knowledge needed to support effective, sustainable watershed management.

          text= "We develop advanced, physics-informed statistical and machine-learning models to identify where water travels after it enters a watershed. These models help uncover the sources, flow pathways, hotspots, critical moments, and residence times of water and solutes within the landscape. This foundational understanding is essential for exploring how hydrological, geochemical, and ecological processes interact across both space and time."

          text= "The chemistry of rainwater evolves as it travels through the watershed, depending on the flow pathways it follows and the duration of its contact with various solute sources in the soil and subsurface. Our laboratory integrates hydrologic transport models (developed in our first research area) with geochemical algorithms to investigate how water chemistry changes between rainfall and streamflow. This approach helps us better understand the link between water movement and biogeochemical transformations within the landscape."

These impacts may be further intensified by climate variability. Our laboratory investigates the combined effects of land-use practices and climate variability on water flow pathways and their downstream consequences for streamflow quantity and water quality."

Our laboratory develops decision-support tools to identify areas that are either vulnerable to, or suitable for, intensive forestry, mining, and agricultural practices. These tools help guide the placement of land developments in ways that minimize negative impacts on stream water quality and quantity, even under changing climate conditions."
