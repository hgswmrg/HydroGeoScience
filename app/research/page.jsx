              Watershed management practices have negatively impacted our environment. Stump harvesting forestry practice for biomass production in North Europe is hypothesized to enhance the excessive transport of solutes (e.g., methyl mercury). Wetland drainage in North America due to agricultural intensification is hypothesized to enhance the risks of lakes Eutrophication and the risks of drought/flood. These are two simple examples of watershed management planning with negative environmental impacts. So, how can we maximize forest biomass yield and agricultural productivity, while minimizing their environmental effects?

            HydroGeoScience for Watershed Management Laboratory advances quantitative knowledge on material (water & solute) transport in deep and shallow earthâ€™s compartments. We also explore how material transport processes vary with land developments and climate variability. This knowledge is critically required for science-based watershed management planning and, particularly, to locate areas where intensive watershed management practices can be conducted with minimal environmental impacts on local and regional ecosystems. In doing so, we develop new physics-informed statistical machine-learning models to learn and infer patterns and processes using big data.

These inferential models set a fundamental foundation for understanding the interaction between hydrological, geochemical, and ecological processes."

Our laboratory combines new hydrologic transport models (developed in research area I) with geochemical algorithms to explore how rainwater chemistry alters before being discharged into the stream."

Climate variability may exacerbate such impacts.
